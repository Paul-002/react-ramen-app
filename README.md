## General info

Ramen-app is a SPA based on React.js library. For all HTTP requests is responsible Axios client. For backend support, I used the Google Firebase platform.

Components are styled by CSS Modules. RWD

The project helped me to understand basic features in React.js including lifecycle components and potential functionality of reusable components.

As the project grew, there was a need to use the Redux library to centrally manage the state of the application.
The project was branched and then merged to the master after making all necessary changes.
